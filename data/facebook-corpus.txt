Got ta keep one jump ahead of the quiz line :
Did anyone out-shine Dimitri Payet ?
After both sides met Monday , the showdown has been tabled until at least the fall of 2017 .
You saw the shot . Now see what happened all around it .
Changes at the top . A shuffle in the lottery . Get caught up here :
In one moment , 52 years of heartache was wiped away -- and secured LeBron James ' legacy in the hearts and minds of everyone in Cleveland .
Chris Mortensen will be awarded the Pro Football Writers of America 's highest honor at the 2016 Hall of Fame enshrinement ceremony .
If you come at the MVP , you best not miss . Or , at least have the right spelling .
The projected No . 1 pick says he has a handle on his future . But what happens when he realizes it 's not all under his control ?
`` I 'm nothing without you all . I love all of y'all . Get ready for next year . '' —LeBron James
The former Dallas Cowboys running back has been charged with threatening a deputy while jailed on other charges .
Translation : Goal , Iceland .
The Atlanta Hawks will reportedly send Jeff Teague to the Indiana Pacers as part of a three-team deal that includes the Utah Jazz .
The Undefeated breaks down JR Smith 's incredible week , from clutch shots to shirtless clubbing :
If the Australian phenom goes first in the NBA draft , the Philadelphia 76ers could be getting a player with a historically rare combination of size and passing ability .
We did n't know some of these muscles existed on the human body :
The world No . 4 said he came to the realization that `` my health and my family 's health comes before anything else . ''
`` I know what I 'm capable of . I believe I 'm the best player in this draft . ''
`` You take some of these assets and that pick and you go out big-game hunting . ''
The Boston Celtics have been pursuing deals for the No . 3 pick leading up to Thursday NBA Draft .
On June 2 four years ago , the chase finally ended . LeBron James won his first NBA title with the Miami Heat .
Dirk Nowitzki will become a free agent as of July 1 , but that does n't mean he 's looking to play elsewhere .
Despite the Rockets ' efforts to convince him to remain in Houston , Dwight Howard will become a free agent .
Five active players . Twenty WNBA legends .
Whoa .
He did it with one of the best free kicks you 'll ever see .
`` He has a chance to go down as one of the top-three greatest players who ever lived . ''
Most NHL free agent classes lack star power . This one is loaded .
Vontaze Burfict or Jason Witten as a coach ? It could happen , write our NFL Nation reporters .
The top two picks seem set , but a shake-up in the top five has ESPN insider Chad Ford 's 9.1 mock draft looking pretty intriguing : es.pn/28N2qR6
You saw the block . Now see everything that happened around it .
`` What I never saw was a game in which it was not obvious the best player on the court was Michael Jordan . We 've seen that with LeBron too many times . ''
The former Dolphins and Browns receiver was arrested at his home after allegedly getting into a standoff with police .
Chad Ford gives us the scoop on what teams will do while Jay Bilas tells us what they should do .
After 10 years of one-and-done NBA draft prospects , we thought about a world where players stayed in college for three or four years . The would-be rosters are pretty daunting . You pick the best :
The Golden State Warriors could enter next year with Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant on the same lineup :
Dwyane Wade will grace the cover of the 2016 Body Issue . The issue drops July 6 .
Dwyane Wade overcame his fear of posing nude in the Body Issue . His photos :
“I can put on a few pounds pretty fast . I love to eat . I’m a fat boy at heart , man , when I’m eating . To me that’s kind of like my happy place : a great burger , fries and a Coke.”
It 's official . These athletes ( and more ! ) will bare all in ESPN the Magazine 's Body Issue . Full roster here : http : //es.pn/28M9omK

`` I do n't have time to figure out what he did or did n't mean . ''
It 's safe to say Rihanna is a LeBron James fan :
`` He was n't the [ Stephen Curry ] that we know and love ... ''
Inside the Cavaliers ' locker room , where the scene is electric after Cleveland earned its first title .
It 's time to settle this thing . Game 7 is LIVE on ABC/WatchESPN .
Game 7 is just around the corner on ABC . Here 's the scene outside of Oracle Arena ahead of tip-off .
The Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors have each scored 610 total points in the NBA Finals . The tie gets broken tonight . 8 ET on ABC .
Oakmont has long held the reputation as one of the toughest courses in the world :
`` When I played League at first , I was bronze . ''
Will LeBron James win another NBA Finals MVP award ?
As good as it gets ?
Of course the Honey Badger made the list :
`` I never thought I 'd be saying this about Golden State , but I think Golden State 's got ta be confident . ''
`` Big Shot Bob '' for the Game 5 win .
Chills :
An ex-Vanderbilt football player was found guilty on multiple counts of aggravated rape and aggravated sexual battery . He was also convicted of one count of unlawful photography :
In 2010 , the city of Cleveland was forced to forget `` The Player Who Left '' :
`` I can’t die now . I’ve got to get back and play ball next week.”
“It’s my own nickname . It’s my alter ego . I gave it to myself . That’s something I did . I’m just like that . I’m that type of dude.”
Game 7 awaits . History is on the Golden State Warriors ' side , but the present favors the Cleveland Cavaliers .
It all comes down to this . Our experts make their predictions for Game 7 .
Darron Lee 's mom has a new gig :
It 's time . Part 5 of # OJMadeInAmerica starts right now on ESPN/here :
`` We 've got a verdict ! '' Do n't miss the fifth and final part of `` O.J . : Made In America '' tonight at 9 ET on ESPN .

The latest indicator for who the Philadelphia 76ers may take with the No . 1 pick in the NBA Draft .
For the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors , the roles have been reversed heading into Game 7 . Now LeBron James and the Cavs sit one game away from the ultimate payback .
`` I was booing Curry as he got his sixth foul . His mouthpiece hit me in the face and he was actually very polite . ''
The last time Mike Miller saw this kind of LeBron James was with the Miami Heat in 2012 . `` He ai n't gon na lose . ''
Stephen Curry was fined for throwing his mouthpiece into the crowd , and coach Steve Kerr was fined for his remarks about the officiating .
All eyes are on Stephen Curry right now for all the wrong reasons . But the reigning MVP can still be the hero in Game 7 :
An NBA official said security was on alert during Game 6 for a credential con artist and mistook Ayesha Curry 's father for the man .
Everyone had something to say about Game 6 , including Ayesha Curry :
`` It 's not fake . It 's not , 'We 'll get it next year . ' It 's , 'We can do this . ' Let 's do this . ''
`` I 'm just proud of him for making the championship without getting kicked off the team . ''
Less than an hour until Game 6 tips on ABC , and Amin Elhassan is gauging how Cavs fans feel ahead of this season 's last game at The Q :

Kevin Love for Carmelo Anthony ? It could happen , says Mike Greenberg :
How well do you remember the NBA Finals stars of the past ?
`` Words ca n't describe how sorry I am . ''
Maybe the NBA play of 2015 , saved for basically the last minute .
It 's on .

Hi my name is sophia . I was born on april 21 in 2014 with something they call spina bifida myelomeningocele . When I was still in mommy 's tummy they found out I had spina bifida . It was scary . But mommy and daddy were up for the challenge . I was a big baby cause mommy had some boo-boos during pregnancy . I had my back closed by the doctors 3 hours after I was born . I had a feeding tube because I did n't really eat much and i couldnt grow very well . I did n't care for food . But I learned to take a bottle eventually . Ive been cathed every 3 or sometimes 2 hours since birth because I had trouble peeing ... that 's a complication from spina bifida . After a while I got to go to the pediatric floor out of the nicu so mommy could stay with me and learn how to take care of me all by herself . The main thing that kept me in the hospital was me not eating . But it was a good thing I was there for so long because the day mommy and daddy were going to bring me home my head got a little bigger . I think I had a headache . They did some test and came to the conclusion I had Hydrocephulus . Another complication from spina bifida . They were going to put in a shunt the next day and thought i was doing fine and it could wait . Mommy and daddy went home with my big sister olivia and we 're going g to come back in the morning because olivia does n't like hospitals . She 's a baby . Well when mommy got up in the morning she called the hospital like she did every morning she could n't stay in the hospital with me . It turns out they did my shunt surgery in the middle of the night because my heart was beating a little slow . I 'm sad mommy was n't there . I wish the would 've called her . She was so sad she could n't be there for me . But she was there when I work up because it took a little extra longer for me to wake up then other people . I woke up in the he pediatric icu . I liked the people there here there was always someone in the room when mommy could n't be in there . But i was happy to get out a few days later back to the pediatric floor because my head incision was healing up but at the same time the doctors made a boo boo and no one told the nurses I was supposed to be on my back . So my back boo boo was n't really healing up good it actually got worse and was just a hole in my back . They had to teach mommy to put this pretty silver stuff in it to get in safe and from getting yucky . Eventually I was peeing more on my own and they tought mommy to cath me to help me pee . That was good . So finally I was gaining weight and I got to go home with my mommy and daddy and my big sissy . I loved it . I had on more surgery when my shunt failed and i had to have an emergency surgery to fix it . that was my entire 2014 year ... But 2015 brought utis ... bad utis that i had to stay in the hospital for and get IVS . So we added new stuff and made changes and are still working on preventing all my utis .
Uhh ... what ? !
Just to clarify , it 's not .

I teach children music in a high needs area in NYC . We just raised enough money to start a school band ! : ) I share your story with my 4-5th graders and we have watched your movies . I tell them about how our mistakes do n't define us and how it 's the way we overcome our hardships which builds our character . Your story is an inspiration to these kids . It 's nice to have to have a celebrity role model that can show the younger generation what `` coming out on the other side '' of a challenge looks like . It 's unrealistic when celebrities act like they have no hardships . You are n't afraid to show you are vulnerable . You are a human . Thank you for everything you do .

As you learn more about Jesus and meditate on His Word ; as you learn about the Father through fellowship , more revelations will come to you . The knowledge of His Word makes us masters , causing your life to be filled with immeasurable grace and peace . Notice the Bible does n't say , `` Grace and peace shall be added unto you , '' but that they 'll be `` multiplied unto you . '' In your life , it's possible to keep heaping up grace and peace in increasing measure . John 1:16 says of His fullness have we all received , grace heaped upon grace . So , enjoy grace and peace in your life , by increasing your knowledge of Him . Praise God !

Jesus said `` So it will be at the end of the age , the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous , and will throw them into the furnace of fire , in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . `` Matthew 13:49-50 . Jesus also said `` You are my friends if you do what I command you . '' John 15:14 . Jesus taught that the only way to be saved is to choose him as your Lord and Master , repent and believe that he died for the sins of his people on the cross see John 14:6 .

Happy Music Day To You Justin 😊☺
All the changes to the Bible by the `` Mandela Effect '' are only to the Old Testament and redefine what sin is . People argue that Matthew , Mark , Luke , John and Acts are New Testament but they are wrong and `` drunk with the wine of her fornication . '' In order to have a testament there has to be the death of a testator , which was Jesus Christ . So if you 're reading something that is before the death of Jesus Christ then literally it is the Old Testament by the very biblical definition of testament . Hebrews 9:16-17 ( KJV ) 16 For where a testament is , there must also of necessity be the death of the testator . 17 For a testament is of force after men are dead : otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth . For the knowledge of the law is the knowledge of sin . This is being done to make it so when the Antichrist comes he will be able to pass himself off as Jesus . Romans 3:20 ( KJV ) 20 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight : for by the law is the knowledge of sin . Speaking words against the most High is exactly what 's happening as the word of God is being changed . We are seeing the times and laws being changed . The laws being referred to here is the Law of God which is the Old Testament . The times being referred to is the ripple effect that 's effecting everything else that has been changed in our reality . The changes to the Bible and reality are really hard on saved Christian 's ; the saints of the most High . Daniel 7:25 ( KJV ) And he shall speak great words against the most High , and shall wear out the saints of the most High , and think to change times and laws : and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time . We are seeing all power and signs and lying wonders 2 Thessalonians 2:9 ( KJV ) Even him , whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders ,

Justin , I know how you feel . I know how everyone around you are minding your own business and at the same time you feel invisible . It 's very boring . And even more so that lot of people filling the bag and always looking for news to midia.Mas know that one day see you ( which is impossible ) I 'll just hold you . No Cameras and steric screams and I understand you . I 'm with you my sexy boy . ( I loved the new hair ) a fan ( since 2009 ) love you . Amanda . Brazil
Ser el MAYOR FAN DE Justin Bieber < 3 es sentirse orgulloso de la calidad de persona q es EL < 3 Beliber Boy por siempre < 3

Jesus said `` So it will be at the end of the age , the angels will come forth and take out the wicked from among the righteous , and will throw them into the furnace of fire , in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth . `` Matthew 13:49-50 . Jesus also said `` You are my friends if you do what I command you . '' John 15:14 . Jesus taught that the only way to be saved is to choose him as your Lord and Master , repent and believe that he died for the sins of his people on the cross see John 14:6 .

`` As viewers , we instinctively respond more to human drama than supernatural . Daenerys’ dragons are instantly more engaging when she’s riding one of them , or commanding them . Otherwise , we’re just watching a CGI nature documentary . We sincerely hope Game of Thrones has more than just visual spectacle to rely on . It needs bastards too . ''
`` A one-man media hurricane dominating the news with insults and provocations , promises and policy pronouncements . He could be funny and coarse and buffoonish and broke all the rules about presidential conduct . This may sound familiar as Donald J. Trump marches towards the Republican presidential nomination . But actually it describes Venezuela from 1999 to 2013 under the reign of Hugo Chávez . ''
`` You 're off ! ''
'Among the brayingly entitled half-jock , half-future-Congressman hybrids featured , baseball caps are still worn backwards and Miller Lite is drunk from a training shoe for a dare . Everybody is loudly heterosexual and one frat house features a fish tank built into its bar ( as if in tribute to the one in Animal House ) and a shelf of empty vodka bottles to “showcase what we drink” . '
`` Western visitors to Egypt are often struck by the sight of men – even soldiers in uniform – holding hands in the street . In Lebanon , you’ll find straight men who spend hours preening themselves and , in Afghanistan , warriors who wear eye makeup . It doesn’t mean what you might think it means , but it’s also less surprising than it might seem . ''
'For example , if the other person pushes for a date , Ghostbot might reply : “Nope , ” “I just have no time right now , ” or “Sorry , just me and 🍕 tonight.” This continues until the pestering messages peter out . '
Donald J. Trump 's presidential run was a protest candidacy . But when the monster rose from the laboratory table and walked no one was more surprised than the Donald himself .
`` Let the record show : calm , reasonable , friendly Americans also believe in gun rights . ''
“It was bonkers . Everyone was having a great time and the kids were chasing after the ducks as they went down the river . Suddenly a police car came along . ''
`` This country is in a pretty messed up state . We have a media that have n't done this question any justice . We have politicians no one trusts and we 've got all sorts of divisions . It 's clearly not the time to throw at the country this very simple binary question . Not only do I have no sense of what 's going to happen , but I have no sense of what the hell is coming next . ''
`` Taping over sensors might seem paranoid . But to be fair to Mark Zuckerberg , he’s not the only one taking a look at his webcam and wondering if it’s worth the risk . ''
The photographer who took the shot of refugees walking into Slovenia talks about what it means to him ... and how he feels about Ukip using it on its Brexit poster .
'Even when we look back and see how much our tastes have changed , the idea that we will change equally in the future seems to confound us . It is what keeps tattoo removal practitioners in business . Psychologists have identified the illusion that for many , the present is a “watershed moment at which they have finally become the person they will be for the rest of their lives” . '
`` It’s the last day of a campaign that feels long and bitter , the final stretch of a debate that has been brewing in this country for decades . There are two camps whose positions are fixed . Yet in the middle stands a group of people , 10 % or more of the electorate , who are still undecided . If you are one of them , here are five closing arguments for what , both sides agree , is almost certainly the biggest political decision of our lifetimes . ''
Multiball mode enabled .
`` Once you’ve determined whether you really are a perfectionist , you may wish to consider whether this is a good thing . If you’re a socially prescribed or other-oriented perfectionist – that is , if your standards are either dictated by others or you impose them on others – then I can tell you straight away that it’s not .

Sad you 're missing out on Glastonbury ? This might help .
`` Lady Warsi 's defection handed remain a powerful argument against those of us voting to leave the EU . I know about this because it’s often been used against me : how can a black lefty be on the same side of the argument as Nigel Farage ? And my response has always been the same ? I’m not leave with Farage – I’m leave with Dennis Skinner and a handful of other brave Labour MPs . ''
“Most Brits aren’t here because they’re convinced Europeans . They’re here because houses are cheap , the sun shines , the wine is good … Some have been here for 20 years and they still don’t really speak the language . They call themselves expats but they’re immigrants really , of course , like so many of us . But they don’t always see it that way.”
John Barnes : `` They talk about what makes Britain great . How we are morally right , the people who will do the right thing . Well that should be helping others in need , setting an example to the world – not running away at the first sign of trouble . ''
Five key questions , on five fundamental issues , that are well worth considering before polling day .
“I understand that it comes from an emotional place and I too felt that disgust . But I wish that people could focus the energy of leaving tirades in internet comments into volunteering in a national park , or donating to a national park instead.”
`` 'Take control ' makes a visceral appeal to older people 's psyches ; to retrieve control of our personal lives is high on our wish list , our failure to do so a daily experience . The prospect of independence takes us back to the good old days when we did things 'our way ' , unaided by Johnny Foreigner . This menu of nostalgia and xenophobia is a toxic dish with a peculiar appeal to the elderly palate . ''
“Hot and smoky , almost irreverent . Imagine WC Fields extinguishing a cigar on your tongue.”
`` Do the Leave campaigners care about the misuse of public money ? No . How do I know ? Because they have scarcely mentioned the EU’s great bonfire of banknotes . You know , the item that accounts for roughly 40 % of the EU budget , or £42bn a year , almost all of which is wasted . You don’t know ? I rest my case . ''
`` I am a migrant from the European Union . You have probably heard lots of things about people like me in the referendum campaign , but you may not have actually heard from any of us . We have got more to lose than anyone else – our livelihoods depend on the outcome – but we do not have a voice , or a vote . ''
`` If there’s one thing the British have never done when faced with a challenge that concerns their future , their very identity , it is to make the wrong choice . A Britain less great than it is would go against the very logic of those who want an exit . It would swap autonomy for solitude , pride for weakness , and identity for self-harm . ''
An audacious operation is under way to rescue a worker from a research center at the South Pole who is in urgent need of medical care , via an airlift which has only been achieved twice in the history of the polar base .
`` To the viewer paying half-attention , as entertainment , the leavers won the night . The hope of the remainers must be that the voters may nonetheless wake up in the night , and distil their dull list of nagging questions into Davidson’s pithy peroration : Why take the risk ? ''
`` What happens when a prime minister tells his country that immigration is much too high , is the source of many of the country’s problems , that it has to be massively reduced – and then immigration remains at the same level ? Now we know . ''
`` I’m 100 % certain that Berta Cáceres was killed by the army . ''
`` At least 55 % of Americans are in favour of stricter gun laws , and it likely that we would have them were it not for the undemocratic structure of the senate . ''
`` It’s hard to imagine Trump responding to a personal attack – like the one he fired at Obama after Orlando – in anything other than a personal way . What separates these two men isn’t just a worldview , it’s a question of temperament . ''
`` Where our different personas are problematic , you can make a conscious choice to be someone else , someone better . This applies even to the most distressed of us . ''
`` The neighbouring countries to Syria that have taken in the refugees are under tremendous strain . Their economies and infrastructure are nowhere near as developed as ours . We can not walk away from this catastrophe . ''
Martin Jennings statue of Mary Seacole will be the first named memorial statue of a black woman in the UK , so why did it take seven years to get funding , and why are The Nightingale Society objecting on the grounds that she was mixed race ?

Vandaag wordt Knooppunt Waddenzee gepresenteerd op het Oerol Terschelling tijdens het Metawad seminar Bird Senses of Places . Knooppunt Waddenzee is onmisbaar voor iedereen die zich in het Waddengebied en trekvogels interesseert . Het boek biedt een vernieuwend portret van vijf compleet verschillende trekvogelsoorten : de kanoet , de drieteenstrandloper , de rosse grutto , de rotgans en de lepelaar . De broedgebieden en overwinteringsgebieden van deze trekvogels liggen gemiddeld 10.000 kilometer bij elkaar vandaan . De Waddenzee vormt daartussenin een belangrijke internationale schakel . Wanneer je alle routes van de trekvogels op de wereldkaart tekent , zie je op de plaats van de Waddenzee een druk en belangrijk knooppunt ! In het project Metawad hebben onderzoekers van het NIOZ en de University of Groningen deze vijf trekvogels van de Waddenzee onderzocht . Ze bekeken de vogels niet als ‘bewoners’ van de Waddenzee , maar als gebruikers van een veel groter systeem waar het wad een belangrijk onderdeel van is : het ‘metawad’ . Het gebied waarmee de Waddenzee door de trek van wadvogels verbonden is , is ontzagwekkend groot . De broedgebieden op de taiga en toendra strekken zich uit naar gebieden pal ten noorden van Mexico-stad en het noorden van Hong Kong . Niet eerder werd binnen zo’n groot kader onderzoek gedaan naar het Waddengebied ! Knooppunt Waddenzee biedt bovendien een kleurrijk palet van portretten van de wetenschappers . Ploeterend met palen en hekwerk achterop hun ﬁets trekken ze over de kwelder . Anderen staan uren achtereen in weer en wind , bakkend in de Afrikaanse zon , naar vogels met kleurringen aan hun pootjes te zoeken . Knooppunt Waddenzee ( € 17,50 ) is te bestellen via : http : //www.bornmeer.nl/winkel/knooppunt-waddenzee/

Some governments of high developed countries are making totally free of charge their universal public education , right ? Even for foreigners . Nevertheless , a very big percentage of the world population will never go there to enjoy these benefits . There is no bigger , nobler , more efficient and effective pro-education act from now on than these countries fund educational Apps 100 % free of charge , translated into as many languages as possible . Not only for teaching languages , as we already see , but also for various school and academic disciplines .

Sometimes I ask myself if you guys try to do everything to not let us student prepare our exams . Example : today all the bike racks were gone . How are we supposed to come to the library ? Flying ? Yeah , and maybe we forget your student card , or worse , we lose it during exams period . Even with a document and my login into my personal page I ca n't get in . That 's riddiculous . First case ever of a student who wants to get into his university and he can-t . Moreover : It 's hot as hell inside . Good , I 'll drink some water . There are cups ( which wont be needed for coffees because some machines dont even work , and starbucks is closed until they feel like , who cares ? ) to fill with water . But NO ! YOU CANT DRINK WATER IN A CUP THAT LOOKS LIKE A COFFEE CUP . Ok , in all this madness we are suppose to prepare our exams . Thanks RUG university . You really make me feel like advising this university to people who ask me .

Our new publications this week include ... Unspoken Politics -Implicit Attitudes and Political Thinking , by Efrén O. Pérez ( Vanderbilt University ) This book explains why people acquire implicit attitudes , how they affect political thinking , and where in the mass public they have their strongest - and weakest - influences . Christianity and Freedom - Volume 1 : Historical Perspectives , edited by Timothy Samuel Shah ( Georgetown University ) and Allen D. Hertzke ( The University of Oklahoma ) In this volume of Christianity and Freedom , leading historians uncover the unappreciated role of Christianity in the development of basic human rights and freedoms from antiquity through today . A History of the Jewish War , AD 66–74 by Steve Mason ( University of Groningen ) 'No study of the Jewish-Roman war approaches this one in level of sophistication , thoroughness , sweep of erudition , provocative ideas , and originality . ' Erich S. Gruen ( UC Berkeley ) The Material Life of Roman Slaves , by Sandra R. Joshel ( University of Washington ) and Lauren Hackworth Petersen ( University of Delaware ) 'The object of this fascinating book is to render visible Roman slaves in the remains of the Campanian cities and villas destroyed in 79 AD by the eruption of Mt Vesuvius … The possibilities raised are of great importance , and in its legitimate concern to evoke the day-to-day realities of life in slavery [ this ] book is to be warmly applauded … The challenge of recovering a history of slavery from archaeological evidence has been laid down , and it is in this that the book 's special value lies . ' Classical World Conservation Behavior - Applying Behavioral Ecology to Wildlife Conservation and Management , by Oded Berger-Tal and David Saltz ( Ben-Gurion University of the Negev ) Statistics Using IBM SPSS -An Integrative Approach , 3rd Edition , by Sharon Lawner Weinberg ( New York University ) and Sarah Knapp Abramowitz ( Drew University ) Written in a clear and lively tone , Statistics Using IBM SPSS provides a data-centric approach to statistics with integrated SPSS ( version 22 ) commands , ensuring that students gain both a deep conceptual understanding of statistics and practical facility with the leading statistical software package .

Georgia 's first Deputy Minister yesterday spoke about a meeting with students of the University of Groningen : “Today we had a meeting with the students of MA program of the University of Groningen , visiting Georgia , and provided them with information regarding the activities carried out by the Ministry with respect to responding to IDP’s needs . In my opinion , it was a very interesting and interactive meeting , where questions were asked and opinions were exchanged . We also emphasized the importance of the EU-funded project that provides technical assistance to the MRA with respect to all processes when dealing with IDPs.” One of the projects they discussed was Human Dynamic 's delivery of support to the Ministry for Internally Displaced Persons ( IDPs ) in # Georgia .

Why is it again , that scientific papers are not a 100 % freely accessible ? It 's a pity to realize that even if I am motivated to self educate after BA graduation , there are almost no free sources of research papers provided ... you need to pay for it . Thats how we give world citizens the tools to develop and progress ? I think we should make a difference here . What about a life long license for graduates of the RUG ? : )

We continue with our theme # TravelinTimesofTurmoil # PlacesofTurmoil On the same day as the attacks in Brussels , 22 March 2016 , Dr. Erin Wilson director of Centre for Religion , Conflict and the Public Domain at the University of Groningen , and Professor William Cavanaugh discuss the question whether religion causes violence : `` ‘religion’ is the problem , but not in the way we often think it is . ‘Religion’ is the problem because we in Euro-American contexts have made it the problem . We have interpreted our history in such a way as to argue that there is something that we can label as ‘religion’ and that it is the fundamental thing that divides people . We make ‘religion’ and ‘religious people’ into something that is clearly identifiable , that is fixed and unchanging across time and space , so that we can contain them and exclude and marginalize them from politics and public life .

Christian existentialism is a theo-philosophical movement which takes an existentialist approach to Christian theology . The school of thought is often traced back to the work of the Danish philosopher and theologian Søren Kierkegaard ( 1813–1855 ) , who is considered the father of existentialism . Philosophy introduces us to the very essence of life . «Has science lost its love for wisdom ? » They say human consciousness is higher , and do not fit nature . Man strives towards justice and meaning that can not be achieved - and therefore humanity needs what nature can not provide . Is it then natural to seek meaning beyond nature and rationality ? There are differences between thinkers that can be classified as existentialists , but still they all claim that reality is partly absurd ; it ca n't be understood only with the use of reason , and that one therefore must use non-rational methods such as faith , feelings , intuition , desire , will , etc . The human inability to find intrinsic value – to seek a higher or deeper purpose in life – is the rational mind brought up believing we 're entirely rational beings . The absurdity in existence itself has no meaning , and we must learn to bear with it . That is simply because we are inexperienced . In the end it adds up to subjective truth – which can not be directly understood . Indirect communication requires appropriation on the part of the receiver . The receiver must experience to understand . Or else it occurs as limitations within the language , leading to misunderstanding and people who criticize others for their own lack of understanding . Subjective truth is composed by introspection and experiences , not propositions or perceptions of the external world . History , science , and speculative philosophy – all deal with objective knowledge , which can be communicated directly and understood without experiencing personally what is being communicated . And for those entirely rational beings , actually they are living in denial . People operate using two separate systems for information processing : analytical-rational and intuitive-experiential . The analytical-rational system for information processing , is covered by the intuitive-experiential , which is fast , guided by emotion and past experience , requires little in terms of cognitive resources , it is especially equipped to handle the majority of information processing on a daily basis . Because you trust and believe in your intuition , it allows us to focus the limited capacity of our rational system on whatever requires our conscious attention at the time . And that 's the very same thing as admitting to how false it is thinking we are entirely rational creatures . With that , your intuition is the typical compass . And often do we know what to do , but then do n't do it . And that 's simply being practical . Being practical is not the same thing as truth . Which means your intuition was giving you a sense of direction . Chess players depend on intuition . Magnus Carlsen says , `` it’s hard to explain , sometimes a move just feels right . '' Engaging in deliberate practice – we aren’t just accumulating factual knowledge . Instead , we’re embedding our experience into our unconscious , so that even insanely complicated calculations can be made possible . Intuition is an essential capacity for Genius . Experts are actually profoundly intuitive . When experts evaluate a situation , they do n't deliberately evaluate all the available options or analyze all the relevant information . And in crisis situations , armed forces , police , fire brigade , hospitals , etc . The analytical-rational is primarily for the inexperienced . Most of us can develop an intuitive decision style by gaining experience . Lack of experience is the reason nothing ever is reasonable enough to some people . And now they are doing nothing else than encouraging others to think more rationally . Actually , people have been doing this for centuries , in contrast to a rational sense which are guiding people from the inside , enabling them to set a good example . While objective facts are important , there is a second and more crucial element of truth , which is to be found in subjectivity . Objective truth is that which relates to propositions , that which has no relation to the existence of the knower . Objective knowledge can be communicated directly . Direct communication consists of statements that can be communicated and understood without appropriation , that is , without experiencing personally what is being communicated . While the one who `` sees himself in existence '' is engaged subjectively , as it appears to the one fleeing , he seems to be in charge of his own destiny , instead anonymous forces of society is the one choosing for him ( in the current hegemony ) . Kierkegaard personifies an attitude with the average citizen . This is an individual who is unconsciously fleeing from the opportunity to live an authentic life . This average citizen often appears as `` morally superior '' to others , but really this is an unreflected individual . The individual are being swallowed up by social norms and others expectations , without even being aware of this . The result is that the individual becomes alienated , both from himselves and the society . An individual 's values must be the result of an `` existential awareness . '' The important thing is to preserve the independence and responsibility in interacting with other people , and it 's precisely this ability the character never did develop . ( Matthew 22:39 . ) Still there is a widespread misunderstanding that there is an obvious correlation between knowledge and wisdom . When people from within a movement becomes alienated , they are barely corresponding to reality . Moving from subjective to objective , to a certain kind of movement , dealing with philosophical speculations . Somehow they call it science . And now they even claim philosophy to be dead . And it all boils down to what seeks to alienate us , that is what comes in between decent people . It is widely believed that God 's existence neither can be proved nor disproved . The problem occurs when people becomes alienated from themselves and the society , trying to prove otherwise . Although there are many , or probably more of the real ( and humble ) kind of science people , this kind seeks to alienate us . Like political correctness , it manifests itself more as a form of behavior control rather than an effort to remedy the problems it ostensibly seeks to address . And with that , objectivism has totally falsified our conception of truth , by exalting what we can know and prove , while covering up with ambiguous utterances all that we know and can not prove , even though the latter knowledge underlies , and must ultimately set its seal to , all that we can prove ( Michael Polanyi ) . The belief that all of reality can be fully comprehended in terms of logic and rational thought is clearly not the case . Rationalists often say they acknowledge human limits and learn what they can within those limits . Well , the idea that the universe came out of “nothing” — it arose as a quantum fluctuation with literally no pre-existing state . No space , no time , no laws of nature , no anything , requires the greatest leap of faith in human history . Is that what it is all about , being rational and everything ? In fact very little of the supposed mechanisms of how the universe came into existence spontaneously is published in scientific journals , instead , atheist scientists write their thoughts on the subject in popular-level books , presenting not tested science . It’s a philosophical speculation , which they apparently believes is so compelling they dont have to give any specification of evidence . Atheists , normally they need evidence , but science seeks to control . Well , you can’t get any evidence about what existed before space and time came into being . Sadly by now this kind have become just as dogmatic and fundamentalistic in their beliefs as the very notion of what is considered to be criticized . And just by the exalting of it , evolution becomes not an argument against God , it is just another process on earth . And it 's all about the origin of life , a scientific problem which is not yet been solved . Around 96 per cent of matter and energy are in forms that we can not directly detect . Dark energy is the most accepted hypothesis to explain the observations indicating that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate , but they really have no idea what dark energy is . Nor do they understand Dark matter . Yet for many people today , dark matter and dark energy are every bit as real as what we can see . And it 's not possible to test hypotheses beyond the observable universe , its total `` size '' , age , the existence of parallel universes ( multiverse ) and similar ideas . let 's face it , we do n't know anything about the universe in the grand scheme of things . It is arrogant for modern man to assume any different . And according to genuine science , they may be able to discover the limits of quantum theory in the next decade or two . Einstein in particular never quite accepted it . ‘It seems hard to sneak a look at God’s cards , ’ he wrote to a colleague , ‘but that he plays dice and uses “telepathic” methods ( as the present quantum theory requires of him ) is something that I can not believe for a single moment . Einstein believed as Bell , to accept that quantum theory can not be a complete fundamental theory of nature . The more science uncover ‘facts , ’ the more they realize we do not know and the gap only gets bigger . Perhaps Kant , Kierkegaard and others had right , and what we think we know may simply reflect the categories of the human mind . We can perhaps only deal with things as they appear to us . How things are in themselves may forever be beyond our grasp . The bigger picture always goes deeper than rationality . Rationalists believe reality has an intrinsically logical structure . But according to the logical assumptions that science rests on , the notion of an infinite universe is impossible . Not only has science limits , but reason is a dead–end . In a three-dimensional reality such as ours , a limitation of the dimensions in any direction is a contradiction , there will always be something behind . Which well proves that dimensions is a purely subjective phenomenon . One should therefore reject all `` theories '' regarding infinite and rather use it purely subjective . And through the recognition of the irrational present , the door opens for the recognition of other paradoxes . Infinite is a knowledge of the unknown , eternal truth and the larger picture which transcends rationality , given rise to the sense of a world forever beyond our grasp . There 's a difference in believing in science and being stuck in it . Faith in reason is simply being idealistic . And that is the reason the very authors now claim philosophy to be dead , it offers a threat to this kind of enterprise .

2014 kende een stormachtig begin . Meint en Maarten begonnen met samenwerken en ze kregen direct de vraag of ze een project van 3 jaar in 4 maanden wilden doen… Nu houden we wel van een uitdaging , zeiden we ja en maakten we wat nu de schaatsgame is geworden . Een serious game voor valpreventie bij ouderen . Het was een pittige tijd vol leercurves , zweet , euforie , teleurstelling , auto ritjes , high fives en discussies . Na 4 maanden hadden we de schaatsgame zoals jullie die nu kennen . Nog lang niet af maar er was een basis die getest kon worden . Mike van Diest onderzocht vanuit Incas3 samen met de University of Groningen en het UMCG - Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen de schaatsgame . Al snel bleek er een goede wetenschappelijke basis te zijn voor exergames . Gisteren stond er een mooi interview in de Volkskrant met hem over de game en zijn onderzoek en maandag verdedigt Mike van Diest zijn proefschrift over zijn onderzoek naar onze schaatsgame . We zijn blij dat we hierin mochten bijdragen met onze game . We toosten maandag met Mike in de Spiegelzaal van de universiteit op de toekomst en met een beetje weemoed zullen we terug denken aan de tijd toen 8D Games begon . https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=OZwTpj4fFyc & feature=youtu.be

“They have re-engineered themselves . Crop breeders may benefit from lessons on how salt tolerance has evolved in these plants.” In Nature ( journal ) , we teamed with European researchers including those at University of Groningen , Universiteit Gent , Geomar Helmholtz-Zentrum für Ozeanforschung Kiel and Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn , and with the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology to sequence and analyze the genome of the eelgrass Zostera marina . Among the reasons for studying it are understanding how eelgrass has been able to adapt to a completely marine lifestyle , and because these and other seagrasses account for an estimated 15 percent of carbon fixed in the global ocean .

mijn naam is Trijntje Roelsma en ik heb 3 schatten van kinderen nou ja pubers helaas hebben 2 van mijn kids de ziekte van duchenne mijn oudste zoon Dennis is nu 22 en staat positief in het leven , ondanks zijn handicap Dennis is een vrolijke jongen die eigenlijk alleen nog maar een beetje kan gamen . nou is mijn vraag aan jullie kennen jullie ook iemand die een controller voor de wiiu zo kan maken dat Dennis er mee kan spelen . Dennis geeft zelf al aan dat als hij niet meer kan gamen het leven dat wel een stuk minder leuk wordt . het is voor ons moeilijk om zo iemand te vinden we zijn ook bij een revalidatie centrum geweest hiervoor maar die konden ons helaas ook niet helpen . ik hoop dat jullie ons hier bij kunnen helpen We hadden iemand maar die laat niks meer van zich horen en dat vindt ik bijzonder jammer voor mijn zoon want nu heeft hij 1 jaar voor niks gewacht waardoor het gamen nu steeds moeilijker gaat ' graag zou ik met iemand ik contact komen die verstand heeft van gamen en zich hier voor zou willen inzetten
